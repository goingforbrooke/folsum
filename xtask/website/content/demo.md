This is FolSum running _inside_ of your browser! 🤯

It's live-- try switching from dark to light mode by clicking the little ☀️ icon in the top left corner.


{{ embed_wasm() }}


This is _exactly_ how FolSum will look and behave after you download it. ✨

> Well, almost. We'd love to summarize your folders here and now, but the browser protects you from the internet by restricting access to your filesystem.

How is this possible? With [WASM](WASM)!
